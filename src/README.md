This is a small text generator with the noble goal of dispensing
the meaningful life changing advice and wisdom of Deepak Chopra.

Needless to say, it's a random text generator.



How to use
----------

Simple enough.  Install globally or locally.  For the example,
we'll install globally, because that's terrible advice, and this
is a Wisdom of Chopra generator.

```
npm install -g choprify
```

Then it's as simple as

```
choprify
```

Next, wait for some insight.



Options
-------

* `-c` or `--count`
  * Issued with a number, this tells Chopra how much information to
    provide.
* `--source`
  * Allows you to provide your own data.  (Remember that many shells
    will expect `./foo.json`.)  There is an example in the `lib`
    directory called `forest_belton.json` which provides alternate
    data and an alternate construction.
